Language: Java

There are several linting tools available for Java, from which Checkstyle is probably the most popular to enforce coding standards. Checkstyle consists of an .xml file containing the configurable set of rules for linting. Checkstyle is easily accessible with different build tools and also offers great plugins for commonly used editors. In terms of testing, probably the most common unit testing library is JUnit. Also lastly, building is generally automated with tools such as Maven, Gradle or Ant, and usually includes the following steps: compiling sources and test resources, executing tests, packaging, health checks (such as lint) and generating reports. In general terms, building covers all the steps to create deliverable of the software.

Besides Jenkins and GitHub Actions, there are plenty of other alternatives for CI CD tools, such as TeamCity, CircleCI, Travis CI, Bamboo, GitLab CI tool, Shippable and Buildkite, to mention few.

In terms of self-hosted setup versus cloud-based setup it would be necessary to know details about the project as well as the environment where the project is built: Is there other teams dependant on it or even developing it - other than just the 6 of us? What kind of application is built, is there, for example, requirement for graphical rendering during the CI process? What kind of resources does the team have? How well-versed are the 6 team members when it comes to CI pipelines; is there necessary skills to build and maintain self-hosted CI? How important is security in the application? Basically if the project is simple, not very security critical and team has limited resources, cloud-base setup is the way to go. Otherwise, self-hosted setup might become the better choice.
